This collection of Python programs serves various computational purposes. The "Simple Calculator" program takes two numerical inputs from the user along with an operator (+, -, x, /) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, displaying the result while handling potential value errors. The "Grade Calculator" determines grades based on percentages obtained in four subjects, adhering to a specific grading scheme ranging from A+ to Fail. Lastly, the "Number Guessing Game" generates a random number between 1 and 100, prompting the user to guess the number and providing feedback based on their input, with the number of attempts tracked until the correct guess is made. Upon success, it reveals the number of attempts taken. Instructions for usage are provided within each program's README for seamless execution.
